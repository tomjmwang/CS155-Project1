                one word is randomly chosen, and one player is randomly assigned as the "liar". all players are given the chosen word's category, and all but the liar are given the word.
                the specific rules are up to you and your friends (e.g. # of turns), but a common way to play involves taking turns describing the word: non-liars try to provide enough
                info to prove their innocence but not enough for the liar to guess the word, while the liar tries to fit in. at the end, everyone votes on who they think the liar is.<br /><br />
